# Tetrp / Kiwi rule-parity and snapshot-product ledger

## Snapshot v3.2 adoption update

Unknown observable activation is now supported as explicit null with three
labeled timing hypotheses sharing the request node cap. Earlier statements below
that unknown activation rejects are historical and superseded. Complete root
geometry retains all candidates while caching repeated landing conversion and
equivalent edge geometry. See docs/snapshot-v3.2-repair.md for current limits.

Updated 2026-09-20. Strategy tuning remains paused. Tetrp remains Phase 4A.
This round is a product/correctness follow-up to accepted artifact 10600729877,
workflow 35500047026, source/build
`15135ae8066c95308a3ae87ce149f5cdc7e13043`.

Read Tetrp `docs/KIWI_SNAPSHOT_PRODUCT_HANDOFF.md`. No entry here authorizes
Phase 4B, a Tetrp pin change, fresh H2, evaluator-weight changes, or a strength claim.

## Invariants which must not regress

- No replay-prefix scan, historical SevenBag recovery, piece-count modulo bag
  inference, hidden RNG/tail access, opponent future information or original-player
  future placements.
- Every external request is exactly current + NEXT5 with
  `bag_knowledge=unknown`, finite visible tail and explicit public rules. TL
  requests also carry the authority attack clock/multiplier and observable pending
  facts; 40L competitive_stacking explicitly carries no TL attack clock/pending
  state and uses neutral root combo/B2B.
- Unknown tail is never expanded speculatively. A finite per-request search horizon
  is not a total continuation-length cap.
- Empty Hold consumes one draw and immediately refills visible NEXT5 before a new
  `hold_locked=true` request. Occupied Hold consumes no draw.
- Every lock/spawn refills from Tetrp's private isolated sequence; repeated requests
  may pass the initial six visible pieces without exposing hidden sequence state.
- Product requests are stateless and deterministic for the same allowed input.
- Default request cap is 200,000 evaluator nodes; post-Hold is a separate request.

## Snapshot-v3 repairs in this round

### Explicit same-piece Hold

Place and Hold are independent root actions. Same-type occupied Hold is not erased:
although the piece type is unchanged, Tetrp respawns/resets the active piece and
locks Hold, so the state transition is not generally identical to no-Hold.

Same-type empty Hold is also explicit and consumes NEXT[0] even when its type equals
current. The Hold action contains no landing and always requires re-analysis.

The preview revealed by an empty Hold is unknown at the pre-Hold request. Kiwi
does not infer or sample it and does not optimize its value-of-information.
The Hold branch is evaluated only through the currently known post-Hold prefix.
Capability `hold_information_gain_optimized=false` must remain false.

### Actual root geometry before Kiwi scoring

The pinned Tetrp helper enumerates the complete geometry-only current-piece landing
set from the actual active pose before Kiwi's first Place expansion. That allowlist
is applied inside root search. There is no top-K fallback; exceeding the explicit
geometry-state bound is a rejection rather than truncation.

x/y/rotation alone are insufficient. Root metadata now carries/audits hy, kick,
rotated, spin, totalRotations, resets, rotationResets, locking, forceLock, safelock,
softDropped and wall. The authority enumerator starts from the complete active Tetrp
piece, preserving SRS+ geometry/spin history.

Geometry reachability remains separate from input timing. Lock/reset timers,
handling/input state and future frame progression remain authoritative in Tetrp;
timing validation uses an isolated Engine clone. Do not claim arbitrary replay
positions are executable merely because a geometry candidate exists.

Dedicated fixtures cover non-spawn, wall, rotated, near-lock and spin-related roots.
Each result candidate is required to belong to the authority root allowlist and
the downstream helper reports its filtered candidate index.

### Stable rule/packet rejection surface

Snapshot-v3 freezes an explicit supported mechanical rule envelope in the adapter.
Values outside it reject with stable codes. Variable public attack rules continue
to be transported explicitly; Surge base/threshold, opener limit, all-clear,
garbage-special and Clutch switches plus root Hold lock remain. TL retains the
authority attack clock/multiplier; 40L competitive_stacking deliberately does not
claim those TL semantics.

Important rejection codes include positive existing ARE queue, unknown activation,
hardened/shielded/unsupported pending status, unsupported rule values, and root
geometry/timing failures. Unknown activation is never filled with zero or guessed.

Pending that has not entered ARE remains a modeled approximation with explicit
activation timing. Positive existing ARE remains unsupported.

## Differential rule evidence

The new release workflow generates fixtures from pinned Tetrp
`0b48cb7e1a50e5f0bba6fcfee05ba8e291bebee2` and compares them against the exact
Kiwi source being built. The grid expands opener double-cancel across pending
amounts, cumulative-sent values and opener boundaries; Clutch spawn/clear rescue
cases retain topout/garbagesmash authority observations; storage-top garbage
insertion covers partial-vs-full top-row smash behavior. It also records pinned
Tetrp public-rule variants: supported variable attack-rule values must round-trip
field-for-field, while the Tetrp-visible b2bchaining=true variant must remain an
explicit unsupported Kiwi rule rather than being silently normalized.

The forecast was corrected so a partially occupied storage top row is not treated
as an immediate garbage smash; pinned Tetrp rejects insertion only at the tested
full-row boundary.

These fixtures are bounded evidence, not full parity. Keep
`rules_parity_verified=false`, full opener parity false, full Clutch parity false,
and exact ARE/bump false unless later evidence genuinely closes them.

## Remaining known limitations

- Empty-Hold unknown-preview information gain is not optimized.
- Geometry search is not a frame-accurate input-timing planner.
- Positive existing garbage ARE is rejected.
- Pending still uses the explicit review pace (normally 24F/placement), ten
  hypothetical clean-hole scenarios, integer clocking and simplified ARE/bump.
- Active-piece repair failure after an otherwise successful garbage insertion is
  not represented by the between-placement Forecast model.
- Complete terminal-reason/topout/garbage-smash classification is not certified.
- Unsupported custom rule variants reject rather than falling back to legacy values.
- Scores are evaluator heuristics, not win probabilities.
- Snapshot-v3 changes root search/compute allocation for correctness. No claim is
  made that its 200k request has the same strength as the historical speculative
  SevenBag 200k regime.

## Phase 4A downstream boundary

Phase 4A may show a landing-free Hold recommendation. Missing landing is expected.
If a post-Hold landing is desired, Tetrp must execute Hold in an isolated state,
refill the preview from its own private sequence, and send a new locked request.
Do not reuse any pre-Hold landing or infer a new one locally.

That isolated protocol test is not permission to ship user-visible continuation.
Tetrp's vendor pin is unchanged by this upstream task.

## Research validity

Pre-repair H9/H2 results remain historical/base-0-context evidence. H2 run
35491099927 remains `completed_diagnostic_base0_only`. No strategy experiment is
opened by snapshot-v3 work and `review_h9_h12` stays frozen for this artifact.


## Snapshot-v3.1 adoption blockers addressed

The previous v3 artifact's placement helper depended on a relative module that was
not shipped. Revision 3.1 removes that dependency and adds both static relative
import-closure verification and a post-upload, re-downloaded package E2E using the
packaged helper, pinned Tetrp snapshot construction, and packaged WASM search.
Passing only the SHA-256 manifest is no longer sufficient release evidence.

The product rule envelope now distinguishes public ARE configuration from current
ARE state:

- real `garbageare` / `garbagearebump` values are preserved and may be
  nonzero, including the replay-observed 5 / 12 combination;
- `exact_are_bump_timing=false` remains because the between-placement forecast
  does not exactly emulate those delays;
- a positive already-existing ARE queue is still rejected explicitly;
- unknown activation time remains rejected and is never replaced with zero.

40L source snapshots use the separate `competitive_stacking` analysis mode.
They carry current board/current+NEXT5/Hold/root geometry but intentionally use
neutral root combo/B2B, no pending garbage and no TL attack clock. This is not TL
parity and not a 40L sprint-score optimizer. It exists so legacy 40L replay
positions can receive the disclosed competitive stacking heuristic without being
misrepresented as TL.

Tetrp Phase 4B remains unauthorized. No strategy experiment or evaluator-weight
change is part of this compatibility repair.
